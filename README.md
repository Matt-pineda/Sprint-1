Matt Pineda – Portfolio Project
Welcome to my portfolio project! I'm a junior at the University of Iowa majoring in Business Analytics and Finance. This project is a culmination of the skills I’ve developed through coursework, internships, and personal learning — all focused on analyzing data, drawing insights, and communicating them effectively through interactive visuals and clean design.

📌 About the Project
This portfolio site was built to showcase my academic and professional work in a structured, engaging way. It includes:

A personal bio and resume

Featured analytics and finance projects

Visualizations created using tools like Excel, Python, and Tableau

A contact form and links to my GitHub and LinkedIn

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
HTML/CSS – for building and styling the site

Bootstrap 5.3 – to ensure responsiveness and modern design

GitHub – for version control and deployment

Azure – to host the site live

Excel, SQL, Python – used in individual project case studies and deliverables

🧠 The Process
I began by planning the site layout, prioritizing accessibility and user experience. I then built the structure using semantic HTML and styled it with Bootstrap. Throughout the process, I refined the design to improve performance, mobile responsiveness, and clarity of content. Each project showcased here reflects a hands-on approach to solving business problems using data.
